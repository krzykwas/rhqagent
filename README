rhqagent
========

What is this project about?

	Shortly: this project is an RHQ agent gathering metrics data from Fedora/RHEL hosts via WBEM and passing that data to an RHQ server.

What does it mean?

	Hosts running Fedora or Red Hat have various parameters that might be of interest for instance for system administrators, who would like them to be monitored. That parameters might include the processors' load, the disks' space occupancy or the main board temperature - just to give a brief description of the kind of data we may be interested in.
	Firstly, WBEM[1] is used to access this kind of data. Secondly, the gathered data is sent to an RHQ server[2], which is then used to maintain the data and act according to the requirements defined by the user.

Additional info

	The agent for RHQ server is implemented in Python. The project is a part of Google Summer of Code 2012 program. The mentor of this project is Heiko Rupp[3].

Dependencies:
1) python-wbem[4]
2) python-nose[5]
3) python-coverage[6]
4) python-lxml [7]
5) python-distutils [8]
6) make
7) rpmbuild (to build an RPM package for Fedora)

	The dependencies may be very likely satisfied using your distributions' software repositiories, though the packages' names may differ. Moreover you might use PyAgent without some of the above, like 2. or 3. used for unit tests and managing code coverage.
